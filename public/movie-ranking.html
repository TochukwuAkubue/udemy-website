<h1>The Best Movies of 2023 According to Tochukwu</h1>
<h2><em>My Top 3 movies of 2023</em></h2>
<hr>
<h3>Nefariuos</h3>
<p>The movie is not predictable and greatly reminded me of <em><b>"mene mene tekel, upharsin"</b>; you have been weighed and found wanting</em> </p>
<h3>The Pope's Excorcist</h3>
<p>I love excorcism movies but this was on another intellectual level; <em><i>I dont even remenber
    if there was any excorcism in the movie but it was bam</i></em>
<h3>The Jewel Theif</h3>
<p>The movie is quite interesting especially <em>where he robs a store and returns the items asking for a refund, as if he actually bought the items originally</em> </p>
<h3>Reality</h3>
<p>The documentary is just too nice <em> especially as there wasn't even the need to fire a single shot</em> </p>
